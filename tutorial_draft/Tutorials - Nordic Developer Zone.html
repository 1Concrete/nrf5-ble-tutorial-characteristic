<p></p><h3>Necessary prior knowledge</h3>
This tutorial is intended to be a natural continuation of the <a href="https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/tutorials/8/ble-services-a-beginners-tutorial/">BLE Services, a beginner's tutorial</a> and <a href="https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/tutorials/5/">BLE Advertising, a beginner's tutorial</a>. It is recommended, but not necessary, to go through these tutorials first. It is expected that you have basic knowledge of how to use Keil, MCP, and nRFgo Studio. Read the tutorial <a href="https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/tutorials/2/setting-up-an-example-project-on-the-nrf51-dk/">Setting up an example project on the nRF51 DK</a> to learn how to use your equipment and compile your first BLE application. <p></p>
<p><strong>If you run into troubles please browse devzone, look for documentation on our <a href="http://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp">Infocenter</a>, and read the user guides for your kits. I urge you to post any questions you might have on the forum and not below the tutorial. This makes it easier for other users and Nordic employees to see and search for your questions and you will actually most likely get a faster response(!).</strong></p>
<p></p><h1>Some basic theory</h1><p></p>
<p></p><h3>Client, server, peripheral, and central</h3>
There are a couple of terms used in the BLE world that might be a bit confusing and the terms might (unintentionally) be used interchangeably. First, a device (a dev kit, a phone, a laptop, etc) can act as a server, a client, or both. This is from the <a href="https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us/specification/adopted-specifications">Bluetooth Core Specification V4.2, Vol 3: Part F: Chapter 1.1</a>:<p></p>
<blockquote><p>The attribute protocol (ATT) allows a device
referred to as the server to expose a
set of attributes and their associated
values to a peer device referred to as
the client. These attributes exposed
by the server can be discovered, read,
and written by a client, and can be
indicated and notified by the server.</p>

</blockquote><p>and:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Client</strong> - This is the device that
initiates commands and requests
towards the server and can receive
responses, indications and
notifications sent by the server.</p>
<p><strong>Server</strong> - This is the device that accepts
incoming commands and requests from
the client and sends responses,
indications and notifications to a
client.</p>

</blockquote><p>Devices can also be divided into four <em>roles</em>, of which only two are relevant to this tutorial. From the core specification:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Peripheral Role</strong> - Any device that
accepts the establishment of an LE
physical link [...] is referred to as
being in the Peripheral role. A device
operating in the Peripheral role will
be in the Slave role in the Link Layer
Connection State [...]. A device
operating in the Peripheral role is
referred to as a Peripheral.</p>
<p><strong>Central Role</strong> - A device that supports
the Central role initiates the
establishment of a physical
connection. A device operating in the
Central role will be in the Master
role in the Link Layer Connection
State [...]. A device operating in the
Central role is referred to as a
Central.</p>

</blockquote><p>So in the case of this tutorial your phone and/or nRF51 Dongle will be the central as these are the devices that will initiate an actual connection. The phone and/or nRF51 Dongle will also be the client as these are the devices that will initiate read and write operations and receive notifications. </p>
<p>Your development kit on the other hand will act as the peripheral. It will advertise its presence to the world, but it is not responsible for the establishment of the actual connection. The kit will also act as the server. You will see that it accepts incoming read and write operations and we will also make it send notifications to your client.</p>
<p></p><h3>Attributes</h3>
An attribute is a piece of information that is assigned a 16-bit handle, a Universally Unique ID (UUID), some properties (like read/write permissions), and finally the value (e.g. the heart rate measured in beats per minute). The attributes are often visualized in a table like the one shown below and it is important to understand that some of the attributes describes other attributes below them in the table. <p></p>
<p>Let's look at an example. Table 1 shows the attribute table of the Bluetooth SIG defined <a href="https://developer.bluetooth.org/gatt/services/Pages/ServiceViewer.aspx?u=org.bluetooth.service.heart_rate.xml">Heart Rate Service</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Table 1:</strong></p>
<p><img src="./Tutorials - Nordic Developer Zone_files/836fcab55bd9955cc812f0a0dc7bc594" alt="Attribute table"></p>
<p>Each row in Table 1 is an attribute. Notice how all of the attributes have a 16-bit handle, a UUID, permissions, and a value. The order of the rows is important as the relationship between the rows defines how to decode the information. Luckily, the organization of the table is for the most part handled "under the hood" by Nordic's BLE protocol stack, the SoftDevice.</p>
<p></p><h3>Handles</h3>
The handles can be considered as indexes pointing to a particular attribute. One can imagine a handle as a phone number in a contact list. The number allows you to call someone to ask for, or give away, information. This makes it easy for your application to keep track of the attributes and grab whatever information it needs. The handle values vary depending on how many services and characteristics you have and the values in Table 1 are just examples.<p></p>
<p></p><h3>UUIDs</h3>
A UUID is used to identify every attribute type. Notice that the Service Declaration UUID and the Characteristic Declaration UUID are predefined by Bluetooth SIG as <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/assigned-numbers/generic-attribute-profile">0x2800 and 0x2803</a> respectively. This allows a client to browse through the table and discover what services and characteristics are available. To continue the contact list analogy; the UUIDs can be looked upon as the names identifying your contacts. It might be a family member, a close friend, or a Bluetooth SIG member company like Nordic. <p></p>
<p></p><h3>Properties</h3>
Properties describe what kind of actions can be performed <em>on</em> or performed <em>by</em> a characteristic. Have a look at the Properties column in the definition of the <a href="https://developer.bluetooth.org/gatt/services/Pages/ServiceViewer.aspx?u=org.bluetooth.service.heart_rate.xml">Heart Rate Service</a> again. Some characteristics, like the Body Sense Location, are read-only. It makes no sense to modify the location value of a heart rate belt as it is always supposed to be tied around your chest. Likewise, it makes no sense to overwrite the Heart Rate value. In fact, in the case of the predefined Heart Rate Service, the client is not even allowed to read the value. The heart rate monitor itself is responsible for sending its values to the client using something called notifications. Hence, the property “Notify”. Table 2 shows the characteristic properties bit field. Don’t worry about understanding the details of the table now. We will circle back to the properties later. <p></p>
<p><strong>Table 2:</strong></p>
<p><img src="./Tutorials - Nordic Developer Zone_files/e17480e6d878b91df2619d6f595dbd95" alt="image description"></p>
<p></p><h3>Values</h3>
The value can be anything. In the service attribute in the table above (handle 0x000C) the value holds a UUID (0x180D) identifying what kind of service it is (notice the "Assigned Number" field almost at the top of <a href="https://developer.bluetooth.org/gatt/services/Pages/ServiceViewer.aspx?u=org.bluetooth.service.heart_rate.xml">this page</a>). The Characteristic Declaration value (handle 0x000D) holds information about the next characteristic attribute. Notice how the value contains the notify property, the next attribute's handle, and the UUID describing what kind of characteristic it is. Finally, the Heart Rate Measurement Characteristic value of course holds the actual number of beats per minute. <p></p>
<p></p><h3>Descriptors</h3>
The descriptor is an attribute with additional information about the characteristic. There are several kinds of descriptors, but in this tutorial we will only deal with the Client Characteristic Configuration Descriptor (CCCD). More about this later. <p></p>
<p>I recommend that you skim through Chapter 3.2 "Basic Concepts", in the Bluetooth Core Specification, Vol 3, Part F for a little more details on what we just discussed. It is actually just four pages.  </p>
<p></p><h2>Attribute tables in Master Control Panel</h2>
Let's now compare what we just learned with the information displayed in MCP if we run the Heart Rate Service example from the SDK. The following screenshots show the data displayed in MCP when connected to my nRF51 DK board running the HRS example. <p></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong></p>
<p><img src="./Tutorials - Nordic Developer Zone_files/9309664efd6ce3e0be2851aab0313e98" alt="Service Declaration"></p>
<p>In Figure 1 above I have marked the Service Declaration attribute. As you can see inside the red square the UUID of this attribute is 0x2800, the handle is 0x000C and the value is 0x180D (Least Significant Byte first (LSB) in the value field). This is exactly what we would expect after going through the attribute table in Table 1. The UUID shows that the attribute is a service declaration and the value shows that it is a Heart Rate Service. </p>
<p><strong>Figure 2:</strong></p>
<p><img src="./Tutorials - Nordic Developer Zone_files/0f0c29065aacbe418585913ef8d433f6" alt="Characteristic Declaration"></p>
<p>In Figure 2 I have marked the first Characteristic Declaration attribute. As expected, the UUID is 0x2803 showing us that this is indeed a characteristic declaration. The value here is interesting. Although the meaning of the values is written in plain text to the right let's decode the value ourselves anyway. The value shown in the 'Value:' field is a string of bytes shown LSB first. To make it more readable we will reorder them to Most Significant Byte (MSB) first:
2A37-000E-10. You might already have noticed that 2A37 is the Heart Rate Measurement characteristic UUID and 000E is the handle identifying where this characteristic can be found in the attribute table. 0x10 is identifying the properties. Comparing the value 0x10 to the bit field in Table 2 we can see that this represents Notification. So everything is still consistent with the attribute table in Table 1.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 3:</strong></p>
<p><img src="./Tutorials - Nordic Developer Zone_files/65b9648d440b867e8a1c8ae661b9b275" alt="Characteristic"></p>
<p>In Figure 3 you can see that the characteristic UUID is indeed 0x2A37 and the handle value is 0x000E, as defined in the characteristic declaration in Figure 2.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 4:</strong></p>
<p><img src="./Tutorials - Nordic Developer Zone_files/ee2a02413227c9338d32a0fd1382f480" alt="CCCD"></p>
<p>Finally, in Figure 4 you can see the values of the CCCD attribute. You can see the predefined Descriptor UUID (0x2902) and that the value is 0x0000 This means that notification is currently switched off. More on this later. </p>
<p></p><h1>The example</h1>
It is time to get our hands dirty! I figured that as an example we will make a readable and writeable characteristic first. Then, after we have enjoyed manually reading and writing some data, we will include the temperature of the nRF5x's CPU core in the characteristic. In case you didn't know already the nRF5x actually has its own internal temperature sensor. It is not very accurate, but it is the simplest way for us to get started with some actual dynamic sensor values. Finally, we will enable notification to update the temperature values. <p></p>
<p>First thing first: download the example code. To compile it, extract the example to "your_SDK_folder\examples\ble_peripheral". <strong>The example is intended for the zipped version of the SDK. It will NOT work with the Pack installer.</strong> If you need help with this please have a look at this thread on devzone: <a href="https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/question/35068/compiling-github-projects/">Compiling github projects</a>. Open the project file and hit “Build”. It should compile without any errors and if you browse through the files you will see that it pretty much continues where the <a href="https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/tutorials/8/ble-services-a-beginners-tutorial/">service tutorial</a> ended. </p>
<p>The important files in this tutorial is <em>our_service.c</em>, <em>our_service.h</em>, and of course <em>main.c</em>. In these files you will find various comments beginning with:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint prettyprinted"><code><span class="com">// FROM_SERVICE_TUTORIAL:</span><span class="pln">
</span><span class="com">// ALREADY_DONE_FOR_YOU:</span><span class="pln">
</span><span class="com">// OUR_JOB: Step X.X</span></code></pre>
<p><em>FROM_SERVICE_TUTORIAL</em> means that this is code we looked at in the previous tutorial. A few places you will see <em>ALREADY_DONE_FOR_YOU</em>. This marks very basic code lines that I have already prepared for you so that we don't have to go through the less important stuff in detail. Finally, <em>OUR_JOB: Step X.X</em> indicates what and when things need to be done in the tutorial. </p>
<hr>
<p>So this is what needs to be done to get our characteristic up and running: </p>
<ol>
<li>Step 1: Add service. This was completed in the last tutorial when we made our own custom service with a custom base UUID and a service UUID. </li>
<li>Step 2: Declare and configure the characteristic. </li>
<li>Step 3: Add a CCCD to let the characteristic send notifications at regular intervals or whenever the temperature values are changing. </li>
</ol>
<p></p><h2>Step 1: Add the service</h2>
As mentioned above this step was completed in the last tutorial: <a href="https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/tutorials/8/ble-services-a-beginners-tutorial/">BLE Services, a beginner's tutorial</a>.<p></p>
<p></p><h2>Step 2: Add the Characteristic</h2>
Calling the SoftDevice function <code>sd_ble_gatts_characteristic_add()</code> is our first goal. However, in order to get there we have to do a few things first. <code>sd_ble_gatts_characteristic_add()</code> takes four parameters:<p></p>
<pre class="prettyprint prettyprinted"><code><span class="lit">@param</span><span class="pun">[</span><span class="kwd">in</span><span class="pun">]</span><span class="pln">  </span><span class="typ">uint16_t</span><span class="pln">                        service_handle</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">
</span><span class="lit">@param</span><span class="pun">[</span><span class="kwd">in</span><span class="pun">]</span><span class="pln">  </span><span class="typ">ble_gatts_char_md_t</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="kwd">const</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">*</span><span class="pln">     p_char_md
</span><span class="lit">@param</span><span class="pun">[</span><span class="kwd">in</span><span class="pun">]</span><span class="pln">  </span><span class="typ">ble_gatts_attr_t</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="kwd">const</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">*</span><span class="pln">        p_attr_char_value
</span><span class="lit">@param</span><span class="pun">[</span><span class="kwd">out</span><span class="pun">]</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="typ">ble_gatts_char_handles_t</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">*</span><span class="pln">      p_handles</span></code></pre>
<p>As you can see the function has three input parameters and one output parameter. The three input parameters need to be populated with details that will define the characteristic. These parameters define security parameters, read/write permissions, descriptors, characteristic values, etc. In fact, you have more than 70 properties at your disposal when defining the Characteristic of your dreams. It sounds daunting, but don't give up and throw away your dev kit just yet, because most of the properties are optional and almost all of them work just fine if you initialize them to zero using <code>memset(&amp;parameter, 0, sizeof(parameter));</code>. Pretty neat! </p>
<p>We will start by populating only the essential parameters we need to get the characteristic up and running. In fact, all we need to do is to choose where in memory to store the characteristic and assign it a UUID. In the function <code>our_char_add()</code> I have already declared all the necessary variables for you and initialized them to zero. The order of which I have declared them might be a little confusing, but since the necessary properties are nested into structures, and these structures might be nested into other structures, this is unfortunately the way it has to be. I have also selected names that might seem a little cryptic, but these are naming conventions used throughout the SDKs and I chose to go for consistency. </p>
<p>The three most important variables are:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>ble_gatts_attr_md_t attr_md</code>, The Attribute Metadata: This is a structure holding the higher level details about our characteristic. For example, what kind of security is needed to access the characteristic and where is the attribute physically stored in the nRF5x's memory.</li>
<li><code>ble_gatts_char_md_t char_md</code>, The Characteristic Metadata: This is a structure holding the properties we have discussed before and also information on whether additional descriptors are added to the characteristics (like the CCCD).</li>
<li><code>ble_gatts_attr_t attr_char_value</code>, The Characteristic Value Attribute: This structure holds the actual value of the characteristic (like the temperature value). It also holds the maximum length of the value (it might e.g. be four bytes long) and it's UUID.</li>
</ol>
<p>So let's start populating the parameters. To make things a little easier I have tried to assign each step a number:</p>
<p></p><h3>Step 2.A, Add a custom characteristic UUID</h3>
The characteristic will need its own UUID just as the service did. And in fact, we can add this the exact same way as we did with the service UUID. So type in the following at Step 2.A inside the  <code>our_char_add()</code> function: <p></p>
<pre class="prettyprint prettyprinted"><code><span class="typ">ble_uuid_t</span><span class="pln">          char_uuid</span><span class="pun">;</span><span class="pln">
</span><span class="typ">ble_uuid128_t</span><span class="pln">       base_uuid </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> BLE_UUID_OUR_BASE_UUID</span><span class="pun">;</span><span class="pln">
char_uuid</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">uuid      </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> BLE_UUID_OUR_CHARACTERISTC_UUID</span><span class="pun">;</span><span class="pln">
sd_ble_uuid_vs_add</span><span class="pun">(&amp;</span><span class="pln">base_uuid</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">&amp;</span><span class="pln">char_uuid</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">type</span><span class="pun">);</span><span class="pln">
APP_ERROR_CHECK</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">err_code</span><span class="pun">);</span></code></pre>
<p>This will use the same base UUID as the service, but add a different 16-bit UUID for the characteristic. The UUID is defined as 0xBEEF in <em>our_service.h</em>. Note that this base UUID was added to the vendor specific table in the previous tutorial when we created the custom service. All subsequent calls with the same base UUID will return a reference to the same ID in the table. This way we will save some memory by not needing to store a large array of 128 bit long IDs.</p>
<p></p><h3>Step 2.B, Configure the Attribute Metadata</h3>
The following three lines are the bare minimum of what we need to describe the attributes of the characteristic. The only thing the lines do is to decide where in memory to store the attributes. We are going to store it in the SoftDevice (aka the stack) controlled part of memory and hence, we use <code>BLE_GATTS_VLOC_STACK</code>. The only other valid option is to use <code>BLE_GATTS_VLOC_USER</code> to store the attributes in the user controlled part of memory. <p></p>
<pre class="prettyprint prettyprinted"><code><span class="typ">ble_gatts_attr_md_t</span><span class="pln"> attr_md</span><span class="pun">;</span><span class="pln">
memset</span><span class="pun">(&amp;</span><span class="pln">attr_md</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="lit">0</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="kwd">sizeof</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">attr_md</span><span class="pun">));</span><span class="pln">
attr_md</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">vloc        </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> BLE_GATTS_VLOC_STACK</span><span class="pun">;</span></code></pre>
<p>In the attribute metadata structure <code>ble_gatts_attr_md_t</code> you also have the option to add some security parameters. For example if you need Man In The Middle protection (MITM) or a passkey to access your attribute. We will circle back to this. </p>
<p></p><h3>Step 2.C, Configure the Characteristic Value Attributes</h3>
Now that we have made our self a new UUID and decided where to store the characteristic we will store this information in the Characteristic Value Attribute:<p></p>
<pre class="prettyprint prettyprinted"><code><span class="typ">ble_gatts_attr_t</span><span class="pln">    attr_char_value</span><span class="pun">;</span><span class="pln">
memset</span><span class="pun">(&amp;</span><span class="pln">attr_char_value</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="lit">0</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="kwd">sizeof</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">attr_char_value</span><span class="pun">));</span><span class="pln">    
attr_char_value</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">p_uuid      </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">&amp;</span><span class="pln">char_uuid</span><span class="pun">;</span><span class="pln">
attr_char_value</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">p_attr_md   </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">&amp;</span><span class="pln">attr_md</span><span class="pun">;</span></code></pre>
<p></p><h3>Step 2.D, Add handles for the characteristic to our struct</h3>
We need to add a variable holding the relevant handles for our characteristic in our service structure. So head over to the <code>ble_os_t</code> definition in our_service.h and add the line shown below:<p></p>
<pre class="prettyprint prettyprinted"><code><span class="kwd">typedef</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="kwd">struct</span><span class="pln">
</span><span class="pun">{</span><span class="pln">
    </span><span class="typ">uint16_t</span><span class="pln">                    conn_handle</span><span class="pun">;</span><span class="pln"> 
    </span><span class="typ">uint16_t</span><span class="pln">                    service_handle</span><span class="pun">;</span><span class="pln">        
    </span><span class="com">// OUR_JOB: Step 2.D, Add handles for our characteristic</span><span class="pln">
    </span><span class="typ">ble_gatts_char_handles_t</span><span class="pln">    char_handles</span><span class="pun">;</span><span class="pln">
</span><span class="pun">}</span><span class="typ">ble_os_t</span><span class="pun">;</span></code></pre>
<p>If you go to the definition of <code>ble_gatts_char_handles_t</code> you can see that our new variable can hold 16-bit handles for the characteristic value, user descriptor, its CCCD, and also something called Server Characteristic Configuration Descriptor (SCCD) which is not within the scope of this tutorial. </p>
<p></p><h3>Step 2.E, Add the new characteristic to the service</h3>
Then we are ready to add the characteristic and it is as simple as this: <p></p>
<pre class="prettyprint prettyprinted"><code><span class="pln">err_code </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> sd_ble_gatts_characteristic_add</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">p_our_service</span><span class="pun">-&gt;</span><span class="pln">service_handle</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln">
                                   </span><span class="pun">&amp;</span><span class="pln">char_md</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln">
                                   </span><span class="pun">&amp;</span><span class="pln">attr_char_value</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln">
                                   </span><span class="pun">&amp;</span><span class="pln">p_our_service</span><span class="pun">-&gt;</span><span class="pln">char_handles</span><span class="pun">);</span><span class="pln">
APP_ERROR_CHECK</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">err_code</span><span class="pun">);</span></code></pre>
<p>As you can see, we are giving the SoftDevice information about what service the characteristic belongs to (the service_handle), the Characteristic Metadata, and the Characteristic Value Attributes. The stack then processes the parameters and initiates the characteristic. It also returns the handle values of our characteristic so we know where to find them later.</p>
<p>Now compile and download your application to the kit. Make sure that you have remembered to program the SoftDevice to the kit as well. Open MCP, connect to your kit, and do a service discovery. You should see something like this:</p>
<p><img src="./Tutorials - Nordic Developer Zone_files/5133d1ea279a4bc7ca7b189f6ca10906" alt="Minimal characteristic"></p>
<p>As you can see there is a new characteristic in our service, but it doesn't do anything useful at all. It has no value and you can neither read from it nor write to it. You can try for yourself by selecting the characteristic value line, type in some hexadecimal numbers in the "Value:" field, and hit the "Write" or "Read" button. MCP will send a write request or attempt a read, but since we have not defined any read or write properties and permissions yet your kit will deny any read or write requests by default. This is what happens when we initialize the read/write properties to zero. The log window in MCP should show something like this:</p>
<p><img src="./Tutorials - Nordic Developer Zone_files/82cd5d273775f55445251800811b15bf" alt="Read and write not permitted"></p>
<p></p><h3>Step 2.F, Add read/write properties to our characteristic</h3>
To be able to read and write to the characteristic there are a couple of things we need to do. First go to Step 2.F in <code>our_char_add()</code> and add the following lines:<p></p>
<pre class="prettyprint prettyprinted"><code><span class="typ">ble_gatts_char_md_t</span><span class="pln"> char_md</span><span class="pun">;</span><span class="pln">
memset</span><span class="pun">(&amp;</span><span class="pln">char_md</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="lit">0</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="kwd">sizeof</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">char_md</span><span class="pun">));</span><span class="pln">
char_md</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">char_props</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">read </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="lit">1</span><span class="pun">;</span><span class="pln">
char_md</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">char_props</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">write </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="lit">1</span><span class="pun">;</span></code></pre>
<p>This will populate the Characteristic Metadata with read and write permissions. Do another service discovery in MCP and note that the "Properties" field in the Characteristic Declaration has changed to "Read, Write":</p>
<p><img src="./Tutorials - Nordic Developer Zone_files/c9e3d98dbe69159a055bb35519950bf9" alt="Read write properties"></p>
<p>Now try to read and write some values to the characteristic again.</p>
<p>But, wait, what is this?? You are still getting READ and WRITE_NOT_PERMITTED errors? </p>
<p>You should, if you have followed the tutorial to the letter so far. This is because what we just did was just setting the <em>properties</em> in the characteristic declaration. Even though these properties are exposed when your MCP does a service discovery we have yet to set the <em>required security level</em> for read and write operations. Before we have done this the SoftDevice doesn't know what to allow and simply denies any reads and writes of the characteristic. </p>
<p></p><h3>Step 2.G, Set read/write security levels to our characteristic</h3>
So let's add some read/write security levels. Since this is a beginners tutorial we will keep it simple and leave the doors wide open. No security, encryption, or passkey needed. A simple way of doing this is to use the macro <code>BLE_GAP_CONN_SEC_MODE_SET_OPEN()</code>. Go to Step 2.G in <code>our_char_add()</code> and add the following two lines:<p></p>
<pre class="prettyprint prettyprinted"><code><span class="pln">BLE_GAP_CONN_SEC_MODE_SET_OPEN</span><span class="pun">(&amp;</span><span class="pln">attr_md</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">read_perm</span><span class="pun">);</span><span class="pln">
BLE_GAP_CONN_SEC_MODE_SET_OPEN</span><span class="pun">(&amp;</span><span class="pln">attr_md</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">write_perm</span><span class="pun">);</span></code></pre>
<p>Now do yet another service discovery and note how the word "Value: " is added to the characteristic value line in MCP:</p>
<p><img src="./Tutorials - Nordic Developer Zone_files/d1fa63cbe0ce97c346f83dca57d46ce7" alt="Value field"></p>
<p>When you try to read from the characteristic now then this should pop up in the log window in MCP:</p>
<p><img src="./Tutorials - Nordic Developer Zone_files/0146b529b3f0625de8d5b822fd25aa00" alt="Read attribute value"></p>
<p>Great success! We have just read 0, <em>zero(!)</em>, bytes from our new characteristic because we have not yet assigned a value or a value <em>length</em> to it.</p>
<p>Next, try to write e.g. the value 0x12 to the characteristic. You should get the following error because the value attribute length is initialized to zero:</p>
<p><img src="./Tutorials - Nordic Developer Zone_files/2f3645d9db203d4012a5831fc82161b8" alt="Write attribute value"></p>
<p></p><h3>Step 2.H, Set characteristic length</h3>
So how do we fix the errors above? Go to Step 2.H and add the following lines:<p></p>
<pre class="prettyprint prettyprinted"><code><span class="pln">attr_char_value</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">max_len     </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="lit">4</span><span class="pun">;</span><span class="pln">
attr_char_value</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">init_len    </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="lit">4</span><span class="pun">;</span><span class="pln">
</span><span class="typ">uint8_t</span><span class="pln"> value</span><span class="pun">[</span><span class="lit">4</span><span class="pun">]</span><span class="pln">            </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">{</span><span class="lit">0x12</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="lit">0x34</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="lit">0x56</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="lit">0x78</span><span class="pun">};</span><span class="pln">
attr_char_value</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">p_value     </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> value</span><span class="pun">;</span></code></pre>
<p>This will set the initial length, and also the maximum allowed length, of the characteristic value to 4 bytes. And just to be a little thorough we will also set the initial value to 12-34-56-78. Once again, try to read from your characteristic and then write a couple of bytes. You should see that the value is updated. Even if you disconnect and reconnect the new value should be retained.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Challenge 1:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Try to write a single byte to the characteristic. E.g. '12'.</li>
<li>Try to write four bytes to the characteristic. E.g. '12-34-56-78'.</li>
<li>Try to write five or more bytes to the characteristic. E.g. '12-34-56-78-90'.</li>
</ol>
<p>What happens? Why are you not allowed to write more than four bytes to your characteristic and how can you fix it?</p>
<p><strong>Challenge 2:</strong></p>
<p>Try to experiment with the <code>attr_md</code> permissions and the following permission macros:</p>
<ol>
<li>BLE_GAP_CONN_SEC_MODE_SET_NO_ACCESS()</li>
<li>BLE_GAP_CONN_SEC_MODE_SET_OPEN()</li>
<li>BLE_GAP_CONN_SEC_MODE_SET_ENC_NO_MITM()</li>
</ol>
<p>Try to do some reads and writes. See what happens and watch out for error messages in the MCP log window. Hint on number 3: If you click "Bond" in MCP and bond with your kit you will automatically add encryption (ENC) to your BLE link. However, you are not required to use Man In The Middle (MITM) protection when bonding.</p>
<p></p><h2>Step 3: Client Characteristic Configuration Descriptor (CCCD)</h2>
So this is pretty cool, right? Not cool enough, though. Let's add some dynamic temperature data, and while we are at it, let's also make our kit a little more independent and useful by making it periodically push data to our client. To achieve this we will need to: <p></p>
<ol>
<li>Add some sort of push functionality.</li>
<li>Do some housekeeping of our BLE connection and services.</li>
<li>Set up a timer to trigger the temperature updates. </li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The BLE Core Specification defines two ways of "pushing" data:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Indication</strong> - This sub-procedure is used when a
server is configured to indicate a
Characteristic Value to a client <em>and
expects an Attribute Protocol layer
acknowledgement</em> that the indication
was successfully received.</p>
<p><strong>Notification</strong> - This sub-procedure is used when a
server is configured to notify a
Characteristic Value to a client
<em>without expecting any Attribute
Protocol layer acknowledgment</em> that the
notification was successfully
received.</p>

</blockquote><p>The subtle, but important difference here is that by using indication your kit (the server) will require an application level acknowledgment in return after every transmission of updated data. By using notification, on the other hand, our kit will just "mindlessly" transmit data and not care about whether it is acknowledged by the application in the other end or not. So sticking to the "keep it simple"-philosophy of this tutorial we will use the latter. To add notification functionality we need to add a descriptor to our characteristic, namely the Client Characteristic Configuration Descriptor (CCCD). The BLE Core Specifications has the following to say about the CCCD:  </p>
<blockquote><p>The Client Characteristic
Configuration declaration is an
optional characteristic descriptor
that defines how the characteristic
may be configured by a specific
client.</p>

</blockquote><p>What is written in between these cryptic lines is that the CCCD is a writable descriptor that allows <em>the client</em>, i.e. your MCP or phone, to enable or disable features, such as notification or indication, on your kit. </p>
<p></p><h3>Step 3.A, Configuring CCCD metadata</h3>
This is what we need to do to add the CCCD to our characteristic. <p></p>
<pre class="prettyprint prettyprinted"><code><span class="typ">ble_gatts_attr_md_t</span><span class="pln"> cccd_md</span><span class="pun">;</span><span class="pln">
BLE_GAP_CONN_SEC_MODE_SET_OPEN</span><span class="pun">(&amp;</span><span class="pln">cccd_md</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">read_perm</span><span class="pun">);</span><span class="pln">
BLE_GAP_CONN_SEC_MODE_SET_OPEN</span><span class="pun">(&amp;</span><span class="pln">cccd_md</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">write_perm</span><span class="pun">);</span><span class="pln">
cccd_md</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">vloc                </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> BLE_GATTS_VLOC_STACK</span><span class="pun">;</span><span class="pln">    
char_md</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">p_cccd_md           </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">&amp;</span><span class="pln">cccd_md</span><span class="pun">;</span><span class="pln">
char_md</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">char_props</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">notify   </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="lit">1</span><span class="pun">;</span></code></pre>
<ol>
<li>We declare a metadata structure for the CCCD to hold our configuration.  </li>
<li>Using the same method as we did on the characteristic, we make sure that no security, encryption or passkeys are necessary to read or write to the CCCD.  </li>
<li>Also as we did with the characteristic, we decide where to store the descriptor, and once again we store it in the SoftDevice controlled part of memory.  </li>
<li>Then we store the CCCD metadata structure in our characteristic metadata structure.   </li>
<li>Enable notification by writing the characteristic property.</li>
</ol>
<p>Compile, download, run, and connect to your kit. Now you should be able to see the CCCD added to your characteristic:</p>
<p><img src="./Tutorials - Nordic Developer Zone_files/11e3429b26b67141564c5b5b9f4aceea" alt="image description"></p>
<p>Notice that "Notify" is added to the Characteristic Declaration's properties field, the UUID value of the CCCD is 0x2902 as we discussed earlier, and the value is 0x0000 meaning that notification and indication is currently switched off. If you want you can enable notification right away, but since we have not yet set up any mechanisms updating the values nothing fancy will happen. Anyway, try to click the "Enable services" button. You should see that the value field of the CCCD is updated to 0x0001, meaning that notification is indeed enabled. You can also use the "Write" button and write to the CCCD manually.</p>
<p></p><h3>Step 3.B, Housekeeping part 1: Give our service connection handle a default value</h3>
In a simple example like ours housekeeping like this might actually not be necessary. However, it is crucial when developing slightly more advanced applications. Furthermore, since this sort of housekeeping is done in virtually every BLE examples in Nordic's SDKs I thought I would make an exception from our "keep it simple"-philosophy and show you how it can be done. <p></p>
<p>Our service structure, the <code>ble_os_t</code>, has a field called "conn_handle". This should hold the handle of the current connection as provided by the BLE stack and we have to initialize it during system startup. Naturally, since we are not in a connection at system startup, the handle should be initialized to some "invalid" value. In the SDKs this value is defined as <code>BLE_CONN_HANDLE_INVALID</code> (with value 0xFFFF). So head over to the <code>our_service_init()</code> function in our_service.c and type in the following. </p>
<pre class="prettyprint prettyprinted"><code><span class="pln">p_our_service</span><span class="pun">-&gt;</span><span class="pln">conn_handle </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> BLE_CONN_HANDLE_INVALID</span><span class="pun">;</span></code></pre>
<p></p><h3>Step 3.C, Housekeeping part 2: Dealing with connect and disconnect events</h3>
In main.c there is a function called <code>ble_evt_dispatch()</code>. This function is called by the SoftDevice after a BLE stack event has occurred. To keep our service up to date with the latest connection events and handles we call <code>ble_our_service_on_ble_evt()</code> from this dispatch function:<p></p>
<pre class="prettyprint prettyprinted"><code><span class="pln">ble_our_service_on_ble_evt</span><span class="pun">(&amp;</span><span class="pln">m_our_service</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> p_ble_evt</span><span class="pun">);</span></code></pre>
<p></p><h3>Step 3.D, Housekeeping part 3: Handling BLE events related to our service</h3>
Go back to our_service.c and find the function <code>ble_our_service_on_ble_evt()</code>. Inside we will make a short switch case statement. In our example the only thing the statement will do is to update the connection handle stored in the service structure. On a connection event we will store the current connection handle as provided by the BLE stack. On a disconnect event we will set the handle back to "invalid".<p></p>

</span><span class="pun">}</span></code></pre>
<p></p><h3>Step 3.E, Update characteristic value</h3>
We are closing in on our goal. Now find the function <code>our_termperature_characteristic_update()</code>. This is where we will implement the notification. First implement an if-statement like this:<p></p>
<pre class="prettyprint prettyprinted"><code><span class="kwd">if</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">p_our_service</span><span class="pun">-&gt;</span><span class="pln">conn_handle </span><span class="pun">!=</span><span class="pln"> BLE_CONN_HANDLE_INVALID</span><span class="pun">)</span><span class="pln">
</span><span class="pun">{</span><span class="pln">

</span><span class="pun">}</span></code></pre>
<p>Here we check whether or not we are in a connection, and this is where the housekeeping comes in handy. If you try to send out notifications when not in a connection the SoftDevice will get grumpy again. That is why we need this if-statement and why we implemented the housekeeping to keep the connection handle updated. Now, inside the if-statement type in the following:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint prettyprinted"><code><span class="typ">uint16_t</span><span class="pln">               len </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="lit">4</span><span class="pun">;</span><span class="pln">

sd_ble_gatts_hvx</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">p_our_service</span><span class="pun">-&gt;</span><span class="pln">conn_handle</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">&amp;</span><span class="pln">hvx_params</span><span class="pun">);</span></code></pre>
<p>First you might wonder what hvx stands for? It is not very intuitive, but it stands for Handle Value X, where X symbolize either notification or indication as the function can be used for both. So to do a notification we declare a variable, <code>hvx_params</code>, of type <code>ble_gatts_hvx_params_t</code>. This will hold the necessary parameters to do a notification and provide them to the <code>sd_ble_gatts_hvx()</code> function. This is what we will store in the variable:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>handle:</strong> The SoftDevice needs to know what characteristic value we are working on. In applications with two or more characteristics naturally we will need to reference the handle of the specific characteristic value we want to use. Our example only has one characteristic and we will use the handle stored in <code>p_our_service-&gt;char_handles.value_handle</code>.</li>
<li><strong>type:</strong> The SoftDevice needs to know what "hvx type" we want to do; a notification or indication. As we are doing a notification we use <code>BLE_GATT_HVX_NOTIFICATION</code>. The other option would be <code>BLE_GATT_HVX_INDICATION</code>.</li>
<li><strong>offset:</strong> Your characteristic value might be a sequence of many bytes. If you want to transmit only a couple of these bytes and the bytes are located in the middle of the sequence you can use the offset to extract them. Since we want to update all of our four bytes we will set the offset to zero.</li>
<li><strong>p_len:</strong> The SoftDevice needs to know how many bytes to transmit. There is no need to send 20 bytes every time if you only have four bytes of relevant data. As an example, let's say you have a characteristic with the following sequence of bytes: 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05 and you want to send just the 3rd and the 4th byte. Then set offset to 2 and len to 2. </li>
<li><strong>p_data:</strong> Here we add a pointer to the actual data. </li>
</ol>
<p>Finally we pass this structure into the <code>sd_ble_gatts_hvx()</code>. We also provide the function with the relevant connection handle. In some applications you might work with several concurrent connections and this is why the function also needs to know what handle to use. Now we have set up everything that has to do with the characteristic and notification. </p>
<p></p><h3>Step 3.F, Update the characteristic with temperature data</h3>
The rest is a walk in the park. We need to measure and collect the data we want to send and we need some mechanism to trigger each measurement. So jump into the function <code>timer_timeout_handler()</code> in main.c and type in the following:<p></p>
<pre class="prettyprint prettyprinted"><code><span class="typ">int32_t</span><span class="pln"> temperature </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="lit">0</span><span class="pun">;</span><span class="pln">   
sd_temp_get</span><span class="pun">(&amp;</span><span class="pln">temperature</span><span class="pun">);</span><span class="pln">
our_termperature_characteristic_update</span><span class="pun">(&amp;</span><span class="pln">m_our_service</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">&amp;</span><span class="pln">temperature</span><span class="pun">);</span><span class="pln">
nrf_gpio_pin_toggle</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">LED_4</span><span class="pun">);</span></code></pre>
<ol>
<li><strong>temperature:</strong> We need a temporary variable to store the measured temperature.</li>
<li><strong>sd_temp_get():</strong> This is a very simple SoftDevice function that does everything for us. Just pass a pointer to our temperature variable and your measurements are done. </li>
<li><strong>our_termperature_characteristic_update():</strong> Make a call to the characteristic update function we made in Step 3.E and pass along a pointer to our service variable and the measured temperature. </li>
<li><strong>nrf_gpio_pin_toggle():</strong> Toggle LED 4 on the nRF5x DK kit. The LED should now toggle on every temperature update. I love LEDs. </li>
</ol>
<p></p><h3>Step 3.G, Declare a timer ID and a timer interval</h3>
Not quite there yet. We need something to trigger the measurements. A trigger could for example be the push of a button or some command received from the client side. In our case though, we will use a timer to periodically measure the temperature. The first thing we need to do is defining the timer interval and we need a timer ID to identify this particular timer. So, locate Step 3.G somewhere at the top of main.c and type in the following:<p></p>
<pre class="prettyprint prettyprinted"><code><span class="pln">APP_TIMER_DEF</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">m_our_char_timer_id</span><span class="pun">);</span><span class="pln">
</span><span class="com">#define</span><span class="pln"> OUR_CHAR_TIMER_INTERVAL     APP_TIMER_TICKS</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="lit">1000</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> APP_TIMER_PRESCALER</span><span class="pun">)</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="com">// 1000 ms intervals</span></code></pre>
<p>This will instantiate the timer id variable and define a timer interval of 1000 ms.</p>
<p></p><h3>Step 3.H, Initiate the timer</h3>
We are getting so close. It's time to initiate our timer and this is all there is to it:<p></p>
<pre class="prettyprint prettyprinted"><code><span class="pln">app_timer_create</span><span class="pun">(&amp;</span><span class="pln">m_our_char_timer_id</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> APP_TIMER_MODE_REPEATED</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> timer_timeout_handler</span><span class="pun">);</span></code></pre>
<p>We pass:</p>
<ol>
<li>Our timer ID</li>
<li>An enumeration called <code>APP_TIMER_MODE_REPEATED</code>. This tells the timer library to set up a timer that triggers at regular intervals. The other option is <code>APP_TIMER_MODE_SINGLE_SHOT</code> which sets up a timer triggering only once. </li>
<li>A pointer to our timer timeout handler which is supposed to be executed on every timer event.</li>
</ol>
<p></p><h3>Step 3.I, The holy grail! </h3>
Ladies and gentlemen, it is time to start your engines! <p></p>
<p>Most often in Nordic's libraries the fact that a module is initiated does not mean that it is started, so we have to call one last function to reach our goal:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint prettyprinted"><code><span class="pln">app_timer_start</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">m_our_char_timer_id</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> OUR_CHAR_TIMER_INTERVAL</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> NULL</span><span class="pun">);</span></code></pre>
<p>We pass:</p>
<ol>
<li>Our timer id variable</li>
<li>Our defined timer interval</li>
<li>You have the option to pass a general purpose pointer that will be passed to the timeout handler when the timer expires. We won't bother with this so we will just ignore it and exercise our right to pass a simple <code>NULL</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Compile, download, connect, and discover services. Now to the moment of truth: Click "Enable services". If we have done everything right the characteristic value should update every second. 
You should see LED 4 and the value line in MCP blink green every second. You should also see values ticking in in the Log window in MCP like this:</p>
<p><img src="./Tutorials - Nordic Developer Zone_files/3b4d20604335a79549608b9be1ae8233" alt="image description"></p>
<p>If you now put your finger on or blow on the nRF51 chip you should also see that the values are changing. </p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Challenge 1:</strong></p>
<p>Try to alter <code>our_termperature_characteristic_update()</code> so that you only send a notification when the temperature has changed. Remember that BLE is all about saving energy so why spend resources on transmitting the same value over and over again?</p>
<p><strong>Challenge 2:</strong></p>
<p>Try to modify the timer so that the temperature value only updates when you are in a connection. I.e. start the timer on a connection event and stop it on a disconnect event. Why spend energy on measurements if you won't use them, right?</p>
<hr>
<p></p><h2>Summary</h2>
Tadaa! You have now made a basic characteristic transmitting data from your peripheral to your central. It is only one way communication and it has no security or other advanced features. Once again I urge you to post any questions you have in the question section on the forum not here. You will most likely get faster response this way. <p></p>

    <p>Hey Nordic! just wanted to say thanks for all the previews and tutorials, they have been a great big help on me trying to finish my project. I'm here on the characteristics aspect (obviously) and i understand the code for the most part just not really sure where it all goes. If you guys could post the code for this tutorial, even though i know you're still working on it, that would save me a lot of time. Thanks again!</p>

    <p>Thanks Martin for this helpful characteristic tutorial!
I have question related to "Challenge 1:</p>
<p><em>Try to alter our_termperature_characteristic_update() so that you only send a notification when the temperature has changed. Remember that BLE is all about saving energy so why spend resources on transmitting the same value over and over again?"</em></p>
<p>I have tried few methods but it still did not work properly.
Can you help to solve the my problem?</p>

    <p>Another error?</p>
<p>I believe that sd_ble_uuid_vs_add should not be called again here after it was already called in the service setup. It caused a NRF_ERROR_NO_MEM in my code and leaving out the second call solves that problem.</p>
